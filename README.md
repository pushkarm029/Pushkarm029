### **Open Source**  
- **NautilusTrader**: Ported critical trading systems (Throttler, Risk Engine, Portfolio, Indicators) to Rust for low-latency trading. Built [nautilustrader.io](https://nautilustrader.io) and full [documentation portal](https://nautilustrader.io/docs).

- **ARK Builders**: Developed a file/folder storage system in Rust. Wrote JNI bindings to integrate with Java/Kotlin apps and implemented a custom LRU cache for frequently accessed data.

- **JaegerTracing**: Rebuilt Jaeger as an OpenTelemetry extension during the LFX mentorship. Implemented adaptive sampling for Jaeger V2 to optimize trace filtering for storage backends.

### **Commercial Projects**  
- **Leapwallet (TON DeFi)** : Implemented optimized token swap algorithms with multi-path routing for moki aggregator.

- **Stealth Data Firm** : Built a high-performance PostgreSQL proxy server in Rust with semantic query transformation, strict privilege management, and AWS S3 model storage integration.
